# GIF Animation production for Email templates

## Synopsis

This document describes how to create GIF animations for Lumia email campaigns from existing brand videos
and how to record Lumia screen activity and covert it to GIF animation.


## Prequisites

In order to follow these instructions, you need to have
the following available:

 - Lumia device
 - Screen recording software. 
    [BB FlashBack](http://www.bbsoftware.co.uk/BBFlashBack/Home.aspx) is used to make these examples. It is suitable for small scale production with 30 tria license. 
 - Adobe Photoshop
 - Project My Screen -application

## Video conversion 










## Recording new videos from Lumia device

Â 1. Projecting Device screen to PC
	Download and install [Project My Screen](http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id#42536) from Microsoft.

  2. Recording 

 3. Conversion to GIF-animation

- Graphics:
		- GIF: Reduce colours. Rule of thumb: 256-128 colors for complex images, 32-64 for simple. Notice that sometimes the image does not even contain that many colors. Look at the color palette. If it contains less than 32 colors, type that color amount (ex. 18) to the field instead. Leave transparency on, even if the image does not have any transparent pixels. This decreases the file size in most cases. Check "Interlaced". If it does not increase filesize more than a few percents, leave it on. This will make the image appear faster as it is rendered in multiple "sweeps".

## 4. GIF optimization

## 5. Alternative video sources
